# NightLightTray

Changing the redness level of the Night Light feature on Windows requires you to navigate to the Night Light settings page through the control panel. I decided to make an old school tray icon to control it instead.  

<ul>
<li>Left click on the icon to bring up the redness meter.</li>
<li>Right click on the icon to toggle Night Light or exit the app.</li>
</ul>
  
  There is a ready-to-use 32-bit executable in the top directory level.
